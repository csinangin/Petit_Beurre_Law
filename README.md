# Petit_Beurre_Law
 
🎯 Data Science isn't just about serious analyses! Even Petit Beurre biscuits can be a subject of data analysis. 😄🍪

In my latest project, the Petit Beurre Law, I took a humorous approach to analyze the probability of biscuits breaking and explored the chain effect statistically. The result? If the first biscuit is broken, the likelihood of others being broken skyrockets!

There's a sitcom in Turkey called ‘Var Bunlar’. I wanted to humorously evaluate the petit beurre law, which is a line in a scene in this series, in terms of data science.
